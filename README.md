### BannerYank
#### About
Banner Yank is a banner grab attack aggregator WIP.
As of now, BannerYank performs the following recon attacks:
*	Telnet
*	Wget
*	Curl
*	Nmap
*	Dmitry
*	WhatWeb

#### Dependencies
All of the tools mentioned in the above section

#### TO DO LIST
My goals for the future of this application are to build on the potential possibilities it provides as a
vulnerability scanner. This includes:
*	Adding more tools
*	Increasing the verbosity of the program
*	Being able to spot and report on common vulnerabilities found during banner grabs
		*	And creating a system for reporting these vulnerabilites
*	Overall just making the application more useful

#### Notes
As of now, the application operates as a simple OSINT tool. Use it as a stoneturner, it will help when you're
unsure if you've checked everything.
